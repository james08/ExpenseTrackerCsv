# ExpenseTrackerCsv
Extract expense data from CSV bank statements

<b>Overview</b><br>
The idea behind this project is to provide meaningful data from CSV bank statements and make it easy to keep the data up to date. The first use case was to be able to download bank statements in csv format and save them to a specific folder and then run simply run this application to process the data without having to worry about duplicates where the files overlap. All data, including configuration, categories, output, etc, is stored in csv files. Output files, including monthly categorised totals files, year to date totals files, etc, are rewritten every time the application is run. This allows the user to update input files, change a category name, for example and simply rerun the application to update all output expense data.
